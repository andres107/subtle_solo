Subtle Solo
===========

Borrows heavily from [romainl/flattened](https://github.com/romainl/flattened). The main focus was to make everything far more subtle. Overall, should allow you to focus more on the code, and less on the noise.

Suggested, python syntax highlighting - [here](Hyleus/vim-python-syntax)
